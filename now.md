    <h2>What I’m doing now</h2>

    <h3>A now page?</h3>
    <p>Yes, a /now page. As none of you may know, I've deleted all social media apps from my phone since the beginning of 2024 (except LinkedIn), but I still feel like I should leave bread crumbs as to what I'm up to, so yeah, a now page. Think of it as Facebook on tranquilizers, with posts that only come once or twice a year.</p>

    <h3>Steam Summer Sales</h3>
    <p>I picked up Baulder's Gate 3 during Steam's summer sale for 20% off last week. To be honest, I was a bit worried that a turned-based story driven game like BG3 would be too slow paced for my likings, but turns out the pacing isn't an issue at all. I actually take a long time to end each turn in combat because there's just so many things for me to try that I'm getting analysis paralysis!</p>
    <p>I could go on and on about how hooked I am, but that would take away my time I could be spending in game, so I'll leave it at that.</p>

    <h3>Work Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn Domain-Driven Design (DDD). I blame my lack of understanding in the structure and development of SAP Commerce on not having a bigger picture in aligning the solution with business needs, which make my development process feel like navigating a maze without a map, and I'm a bit tired of running into the same dead-ends over and over again.</li>
      <li>Take more initiatives in technical communication. This has to do with overcoming imposter syndrome since I never feel like I'm the right person to answer questions. There's always this fear of “what if I do a shit job and fuck up the explanation, blah blah blah…” but yeah. Gotta get over that somehow, or at least mitigate it a bit.</li>
    </ul>
