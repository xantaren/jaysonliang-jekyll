    <h3>How long have you been a programmer?</h3>
    <p>A couple years now. I'd probably be pushing papers right now if it wasn't for Covid denying me of an office job in 2020.</p>

    <h3>What are you working on?</h3>
    <p>I'm currently working on optimizing and implementing e-commerce solutions for various brands; <a href="https://www.samsung.com/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.lecta.com/">Lecta</a>, <a href="https://www.grupocadarso.com/">Grupo Cadarso</a> to name a few.</p>

    <h3>What's the website for?</h3>
    <p>Well, all the cool kids have one so I figured I might as well get one.</p>
